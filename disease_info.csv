2,"Covered Kernel Smut","Sanitation and seed treatment are essential for controlling covered kernel smut in sorghum. Caused by the fungus Sporisorium sorghi, covered kernel smut affects the kernels, causing them to swell and become covered by a hard, black, spore-producing mass. These smut balls replace the normal seeds and can significantly reduce both yield and seed quality. The disease primarily spreads through infected seeds, so using clean, certified seed is the first line of defense.

To control covered kernel smut, start by planting disease-free seed from reliable sources. Infected kernels from previous crops can harbor the fungus, so it's important to remove all crop debris from the field. Fungicide seed treatments, such as those containing carboxin or thiabendazole, can help prevent infection and protect the seeds from smut spores before planting. Organic growers may consider using hot water treatment to reduce the risk of seedborne infection, but this requires careful temperature control to avoid damaging the seeds.
Monitoring the plants during flowering is important, as early detection of symptoms can help limit the spread of the disease. Infected plants should be removed and destroyed to prevent spore dispersal to healthy plants. Since the disease can also be spread by wind, crop rotation and field sanitation practices are key to reducing the disease pressure for future seasons.

3,"Head Smut","Sanitation and early intervention are key in managing head smut in sorghum. Head smut is caused by the fungus Sporisorium reilianum and typically affects the developing flower head, causing it to swell and turn into a mass of white or gray spores. These spore masses can be wind-dispersed and infect other plants, spreading the disease. The primary source of infection is infected seeds or plant debris from previous seasons, making good field hygiene essential.

To control head smut, start by using disease-free, certified seed to reduce the initial inoculum. Any infected plants or debris should be removed and destroyed to prevent the spread of spores. It is important to monitor fields regularly, particularly during the flowering stage when symptoms become evident. Fungicides are generally not effective for head smut once the plants are infected, so preventive measures are the most reliable strategy.

For organic growers, focusing on resistant varieties, proper seed treatment, and crop rotation is crucial. Hot water seed treatment can help reduce seedborne infection but must be done with caution to avoid damaging the seed. Infected plants should be carefully destroyed to minimize the risk of spore dissemination.

5,Rust,"Sanitation is the first step in managing rust in sorghum. Remove and destroy all crop residues and volunteer sorghum plants from previous seasons, as these can harbor rust spores. This is particularly important in regions with mild winters, where the fungus can survive between growing seasons. Rust in sorghum is caused by Puccinia purpurea, and while some sorghum varieties show partial resistance, no variety is entirely immune. Regular monitoring�at least once a week�is essential, especially during warm, humid periods, which favor the development and spread of rust.

When rust is detected, early intervention is critical. Fungicides containing active ingredients like propiconazole, azoxystrobin, or tebuconazole can help manage the disease, especially when applied preventively or at the first sign of symptoms. These treatments may require multiple applications throughout the growing season. For organic sorghum production, options are limited, so emphasis should be placed on resistant cultivars, crop rotation, and maintaining proper field hygiene. In all cases, severely infected plants should be removed and destroyed to reduce the spread of rust spores to healthy plants.","Rust in sorghum is caused by fungal pathogens, primarily Puccinia purpurea. It is a significant disease that affects sorghum crops, leading to yellow-orange pustules on the leaves, stems, and panicles. These pustules release spores that can spread the disease to other plants. Rust typically causes reduced photosynthesis, leading to stunted growth, premature leaf drop, and yield loss. The disease is most severe in warm, humid conditions. Management strategies include using resistant sorghum varieties, applying fungicides, and practicing crop rotation to reduce the risk of infection.",https://thebeatsheet.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sorghum-rust-1-WM.png
6,"Loose Smut","Seed sanitation is the first and most important step in controlling loose smut in sorghum. Caused by the fungus Sporisorium cruentum, loose smut survives within the seed and does not show any external symptoms until the plant reaches the flowering stage. Infected plants produce black, powdery spore masses instead of normal grain heads, leading to significant yield loss. Because the disease is internally seed-borne, removing crop debris alone is not sufficient�using disease-free, certified seed is essential to prevent its introduction and spread.

Currently, there are no chemical treatments that can cure plants once they are infected. However, treating seeds before planting with systemic fungicides such as carboxin or tebuconazole can effectively prevent infection. For organic growers, using hot water treatment (at carefully controlled temperatures) can reduce seedborne inoculum, though it must be done precisely to avoid damaging seed viability. Crop rotation and destruction of infected plants before they release spores can also help reduce the disease pressure in future seasons.

Regular inspection during heading and flowering is key, as early detection can limit spore dispersal. Since loose smut can persist in saved seed, never store or replant seeds from infected plants.","Loose smut in sorghum is a fungal disease caused by Sphacelotheca sorghi. It affects the plant by infecting the florets, causing them to turn into a loose, powdery mass of spores instead of healthy seeds. This disease usually results in reduced grain yield and poor-quality seeds. The symptoms typically appear when the plant is flowering, with infected heads becoming swollen and covered in a grayish or white fungal mass. Loose smut is most commonly spread through infected seed or soil. Control methods include using resistant varieties, treating seeds with fungicides, and practicing crop rotation.",https://agritech.tnau.ac.in/crop_protection/sorghum_disease/images/sorghum%20smut.JPG
